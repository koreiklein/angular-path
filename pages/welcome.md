# Introduction

Welcome to Awesome Web Apps with Angular!

If you've heard about Angular and maybe even tried it out and are ready to get serious, you've come to the right place. This Path combines material from the official Angular Developer Guide and adds in flavor from blog posts written by independent developer authors.

As you go through the path, you can track your progress and put your learning to practice with tasks that are included in the Modules.

If you have any feedback, go ahead and use the Feedback bar on the right.

Hope you enjoy the ride!
